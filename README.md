# Simple iPhone App

Welcome! This is a basic iOS app template to get you started.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this app, you'll need:

1. **A Mac** - iOS development requires macOS
2. **Xcode** - Download it for free from the Mac App Store
   - Search for "Xcode" in the App Store
   - It's large (several GB), so download when you have time
3. **An Apple ID** - Free account works fine for testing on simulators

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Xcode
1. Open the Mac App Store
2. Search for "Xcode"
3. Click "Get" or "Install"
4. Wait for it to download and install (this can take a while!)

### Step 2: Create a New Xcode Project
1. Open Xcode
2. Click "Create a new Xcode project"
3. Select "iOS" → "App"
4. Click "Next"
5. Fill in:
   - **Product Name**: MyFirstApp (or whatever you like)
   - **Interface**: SwiftUI
   - **Language**: Swift
   - **Storage**: None (for now)
6. Choose where to save it
7. Click "Create"

### Step 3: Replace the Default Code
1. In Xcode, find `ContentView.swift` in the left sidebar
2. Replace its contents with the code from `ContentView.swift` in this folder
3. Find `App.swift` (or `MyFirstAppApp.swift`) and replace it with the code from `App.swift`

### Step 4: Run Your App
1. Click the play button (▶️) at the top of Xcode
2. Or press `Cmd + R`
3. Choose a simulator (like "iPhone 15" or "iPhone 15 Pro")
4. Your app will launch in the simulator!
